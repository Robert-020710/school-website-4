    <p id="parragraph of school">Hello I am the principal of the school and we are glad you are in our website, this school treats children a different way by having children do their chores and learn the lessons of life through play and technology that way children have a lot of skills to use when they are responsible members of soceity. We also think students should learn that their voice matters and that they should be listened. Again thank you for coming to the school's website and goodbye.</p>
